## Overview of Controllers

The functions are split in three ways, one for each type of user: 

  - PublicController: A non-registered user
  - UserController: A registered user
  - HostController: Host user. 
  
See comments within each file to see documentation/explanation on what the functions are and how they work!

### The actual code, though mingles with the handlebars and the util functions, so to really get the hang of how they work and what they do, please host the website on your local devices using node. Also, if you need clarification on stuff, don't hesitate to ask me! - Sam
